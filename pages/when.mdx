# When am I done?

Check coverage and follow the 80/20 rule. After you reach a certain amount of coverage, tests become more difficult and less valuable to write.

Always consider when writing:

- Will this test save me time?
- Will this test give me more confidence?

BUT you should try to test regressions and new features continually.
