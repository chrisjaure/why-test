# How: Step by step

Let's test this component! This guide assumes you are using Create React App, which has already done some steps for you.

```jsx Component.jsx
export function Component() {
  return <div>My component</div>
}
```

---

## Step 1

Install the new dependencies. Jest is already installed so we'll need to add React Testing Library.

```fish
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

---

## Step 2

Extend Jest's assertions with [testing library's assertions](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom#table-of-contents) by importing them in `src/setupTests.js`:

This will allow us to expect elements `toBeInTheDocument` or `toBeDisabled`.

```js src/setupTests.js
import '@testing-library/jest-dom'
```

_Note_: you only need to do steps 1 and 2 once in your project. When writing additional tests, start from Step 3.

---

## Step 3

Create a new file with a name that matches the name of the file you want to test, adding the suffix `.test.jsx`. Jest will find all files that match `*.test.jsx` and run them.

We can start by importing the dependencies we need: React Testing Library and the component we want to test.

```jsx Component.test.jsx
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react'
import {Component} from './Component'
```

---

## Step 4

Create a `test` block. Jest exposes some [global variables](https://jestjs.io/docs/api) like `expect`, `jest`, and `test`, which is why we don't need to import them.

`test` is a function that accepts two arguments: a description of the test, and a function that contains the test code.

```jsx Component.test.jsx
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react'
import {Component} from './Component'

// mark(1:3)
// focus(1:3)
test('the component renders content', () => {
  // our test code will go here
})
```

---

## Step 5

Set up the test. With React Testing Library, this usually means calling `render` with your component.

```jsx Component.test.jsx focus=1[9:14],2[9:17]
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react'
import {Component} from './Component'

test('the component renders content', () => {
  // mark(1:2)
  // focus(1:3)
  // setup
  render(<Component />)  
})
```

---

## Step 6

Assert that the component content is in the document.

```jsx Component.test.jsx focus=1[17:22]
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react'
import {Component} from './Component'

test('the component renders content', () => {
  // setup
  render(<Component />)

  // mark(1:2)
  // focus(1:2)
  // assert
  expect(screen.getByText('My content')).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

---

## Step 7

Run the tests from the command line.

```fish
npm test
```

You will see some output like:

```fish
PASS  ./src/Component.test.js
âœ“ the component renders content (5ms)
```

This works because Create React App added this for your test script in `package.json`:

```json package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "react-scripts test"
  }
}
```

`react-scripts test` in turn runs `jest`.

## Tips

### Debugging

- Call `screen.debug()` after rendering to see the rendered html of your component in your terminal. This will help you see what content you can test for.
- If you prefer a more visual version of the above, call `screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL()` to get a link to a UI that shows your rendered component. See [testing-playground.com](https://testing-playground.com/) for an example. This UI will even suggest what kind of query to use as you interact with your rendered component!
- Install the [Jest VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest) to make running and debugging tests a lot easier.

### Not sure what to test?

- Look at [the matchers](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom#table-of-contents) that you can use to get an idea of what's easy to test with React Testing Library.
- Think about it from the user's perspective. What would they need to do or see in order to complete their task?
- Avoid testing visuals like design or styles and focus on testing functionality.
