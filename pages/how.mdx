# How to test?

Choose your own adventure! But keep in mind these are complementary; you should have every type in your test suite.

## Unit test – [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

Test a single function, method, or component.

### Pros

- Easiest to write for utility functions or simple components.
- Quick to run.
- Minimal setup and context needed.
- Easy to understand why a test has failed.

### Cons

- Gives you the least confidence that your app works.

### Example

<CH.Code>
```javascript utility.js
/* Executes a function n times */
export function times(n, func) {
  Array.from(Array(times)).forEach(() => {
    func()
  })
}
```

---

```javascript utility.test.js
import {times} from './utility'

test('times should execute a function n times', () => {
  // setup
  const mockFn = jest.fn()

  // act
  times(4, mockFn)

  // assert
  expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(4)
})
```
</CH.Code>

## Integration test – [RTL](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

Test interactions between layers of your code in a single stack. Glue tests.

### Pros

- Increased confidence that your app works.
- More closely simulates how a user will use your app.

### Cons

- Understanding how all the layers interact with each other can be difficult.
- More moving peices means it's more difficult to find out why a test has failed.

### Example

<CH.Section>
[Set up the mocks](focus://7:11), [perform user actions](focus://13:16), [assert expected behavior](focus://18:23).

```javascript LoginPage.test.js
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
import LoginPage from './LoginPage'
import * as api  from './api'

test('LoginPage should allow user to log in', async () => {
  // setup
  const apiResponse = { message: 'Logged in!' }
  jest.spyOn(api, 'postRequest').mockResolvedValue(apiResponse)
  const user = userEvent.setup()
  render(<LoginPage />)

  // act
  await user.type(screen.getByLabelText('username'), 'Chris')
  await user.type(screen.getByLabelText('password'), 'my secret password!')
  await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', {name: "Login"}))

  // assert
  expect(await screen.findByText('Logged in!')).toBeInTheDocument()
  expect(api.postRequest).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
    username: 'Chris',
    password: 'my secret password!'
  })
})
```
</CH.Section>

## End-to-end test – [Cypress](https://cypress.io)

Test the entire stack – client, server, database.

### Pros

- Gives you the most confidence.
- A single test can verify all layers of your app, multiplying the value.

### Cons

- Hardest to setup.
- Slowest to run.
- Test failures need a lot of investigation.
- High risk of flaky tests.
